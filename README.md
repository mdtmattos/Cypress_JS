## Introduction
Test automation in order to verify and test the application https://www.demoblaze.com/ using Cypress as a framework along with cucumber to specify test cases and structure in gherkin for better understanding, Javascript as language and Allure as report.<br />

All test cases are independent of each other. That is, one does not depend on the other or on any data generated by a previous test case.

## Install
Run command line on terminal to install all dependencies:
npm install

## Version of Cypress and Report

- "cy:open": "npx cypress open --env allure=true"
- "cy:run": "cypress run --env allure=true"
- "allure-report-generate": "allure generate allure-results --clean && allure open allure-report"
