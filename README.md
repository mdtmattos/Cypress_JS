# TheoremOne - Test Automation Engineer

## Introduction

Test automation in order to verify and test the application https://www.demoblaze.com/ using Cypress as a framework along with cucumber to specify test cases and structure in gherkin for better understanding, Javascript as language and Allure as report.<br />

All test cases are independent of each other. That is, one does not depend on the other or on any data generated by a previous test case.

## Install

Run command line on terminal to install all dependencies:
npm install

## Version of Cypress and Report
  * Cypress: version 12.9.0
  * Allure Report: version 2.26.5

## Script to run tests and generate the report
You can find the scripts on package.json file

- "cy:open": "npx cypress open --env allure=true"
- "cy:run": "cypress run --env allure=true"
- "allure-report-generate": "allure generate allure-results --clean && allure open allure-report"

cy:open - Will open Cypress dashboard and start the test manually <br />
cy:run - Will run all test cases in headless <br />
allure-report-generate: After finish the test must run this script to generate the report <br />
