# TheoremOne - Test Automation Engineer

## Introduction

Greetings, you have been called in to work as a consultant for a client that’s about to launch an
e-commerce site that specializes in phones and other tech: https://www.demoblaze.com/

The client has requested some automated testing put in place to both add testing coverage for this initial launch, and to also serve as an example of good practices for their own resources to follow.

## Assignment

Your task consists of designing, creating and implementing the automated framework for the client’s site following the specifications detailed further below.

Before you start, take into consideration the following:

* This is an “up to” 8 hour exercise. While we will not be tracking your time, we do ask that you honor the spirit of this constraint. We understand this exercise is performed around other commitments you have, so please outline to us how you expect to complete the task.

* We ask that you communicate your expected delivery timeframe and what you think you can accomplish to the “client” and commit to that. As with any client, if you feel further communication or expectation resets are required, please do so! Feel free to discuss prioritization as well.

* Further, we understand that this is a lot to cover in 8 hours! Too much, possibly. We are looking for you to prioritize, gain alignment, communicate expectations — then fulfill the commitments that you make with your client.

* The ultimate artifact for this exercise should be saved to this same GitHub repository, commit/push all changes here.

* Please include the test suite that you create, documentation on how to install necessary tooling and run the suite, and an example test report from your suite’s output.

## Specifications

* These are the areas that the client requested coverage for:
  * Account creation
  * Login
  * Browsing the store’s main categories (Phones, Laptops, Monitors)
  * Play About Us video
  * Send a message through Contact
  * Shopping cart
  * Checkout
  
* The framework and tool selection is up to you, but here are some ideas that might help the implementation to serve as an example of good practices:
  * Including a way to pass along custom data for tests where needed, as the catalog is going to be changing frequently.
  * Having comments put in place to help with the handover of the code to the client.

* Any scenarios and needs outside of what the client has requested that you feel should be included can be documented and optionally added to the automated suite, if time allows it.

* Finally, what would you do differently if you had more time? A few sentences in the README of the repository are enough.

## Site Rules

* Don’t blast the site with too many requests
* Don’t leave scripts running
* Don’t use any kind of personal data on the site
